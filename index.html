            <p>A few hundred random dots were generated and subsequently sorted.
            This is what the sorted list of dots looks like. A random dot was
            chosen as the 'goal'. That's the dot the red line intersects. The
            program knows the goal dot's height, but it doesn't know its horizontal
            location. It could check every single dot until it finds one with
            matching height, but that's naive. Instead, it can take advantage of
            the fact that it's able to compare guesses to the goal dot's height.
            The list is sorted, so very few dots need to be checked.</p>

            <p>Binary search is the most common method used to solve this problem.
            This page explores alternatives that are more efficient in certain
            scenarios. Use the 'Step' button to watch the program guess dots one
            at a time. It stops once it finds the goal dot.</p>
